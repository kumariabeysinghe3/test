"""
Starting template for creating an email simulator program using
classes, methods, and functions.

This template provides a foundational structure to develop your own
email simulator. It includes placeholder functions and conditional statements
with 'pass' statements to prevent crashes due to missing logic.
Replace these 'pass' statements with your implementation once you've added
the required functionality to each conditional statement and function.

Note: Throughout the code, update comments to reflect the changes and logic
you implement for each function and method.
